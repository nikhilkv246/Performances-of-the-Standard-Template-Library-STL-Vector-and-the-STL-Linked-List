# Performances-of-the-Standard-Template-Library-STL-Vector-and-the-STL-Linked-List

In this project, we have compared the performances of the Standard Template Library
(STL) vector and the STL linked list. A test program causes the vector and the linked list
to undergo an identical set of operations, and it will time how long it takes each data
structure to perform the operations. The program prints a table that compares the
timings for vectors and lists of various sizes: 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, and
100000.
Classes SortedVector (based on the STL vector) and SortedList (based on the
STK list) keep their data sorted in smallest to largest order. They have an identical set of
member functions whose performances have been tested and timed.
